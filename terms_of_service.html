          advertisers are solely between you and the advertiser.</p>

        <h2>6. Premium Subscription</h2>

        <h3>6.1 Premium Features</h3>
        <p>Artkiv offers a Premium subscription ("Premium") that provides enhanced features, including but not limited
          to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Ad-free experience — complete removal of all advertisements</li>
          <li>Unlimited items, transactions, and sales records — removes storage and usage caps present in the free
            version</li>
          <li>Unlimited backups — create and manage backups without limits</li>
          <li>Early access to new features and priority access to updates</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Premium features are subject to change, and we may add or remove features at our discretion. We will make
          reasonable efforts to notify users of significant changes. Promotional pricing or limited-time offers (for
          example, introductory pricing shown on our website or in the App) may be available from time to time and are
          subject to change.</p>

        <h3>6.2 Subscription Terms</h3>
        <p>Premium subscriptions are available on a recurring basis (monthly, yearly, or other periods as offered). Key
          terms
          include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Auto-Renewal:</strong> Subscriptions automatically renew at the end of each billing period unless
            canceled at least 24 hours before the renewal date</li>
          <li><strong>Billing:</strong> You will be charged through your Apple App Store or Google Play Store account
          </li>
          <li><strong>Price Changes:</strong> We reserve the right to change subscription prices with advance notice.
            Price
            changes will apply to subsequent billing periods after notice is provided</li>
          <li><strong>Free Trials:</strong> If offered, free trials will automatically convert to paid subscriptions
            unless
            canceled before the trial period ends</li>
          <li><strong>Promotional Pricing:</strong> From time to time we may offer promotional or introductory pricing.
            Such offers are temporary and may change or end at
            any time.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.3 Payment Processing</h3>
        <p>All payments are processed through Apple App Store (iOS) or Google Play Store (Android) using their
          respective
          in-app purchase systems. We use RevenueCat, a third-party subscription management service, to manage and
          verify
          in-app purchases across platforms. We do not directly process or store your payment information.</p>
        <p>RevenueCat acts as an intermediary between Artkiv and the app stores to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Validate and verify purchase receipts</li>
          <li>Manage subscription status and entitlements</li>
          <li>Track subscription events (renewals, cancellations, refunds)</li>
          <li>Provide cross-platform subscription management</li>
        </ul>
        <p>By purchasing Premium, you agree to the terms of both your platform provider and RevenueCat:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Apple:</strong> <a href="https://www.apple.com/legal/internet-services/itunes/us/terms.html"
              target="_blank">App Store Terms of Service</a></li>
          <li><strong>Google:</strong> <a href="https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/about/play-terms/"
              target="_blank">Google
              Play Terms of Service</a></li>
          <li><strong>RevenueCat:</strong> <a href="https://www.revenuecat.com/terms" target="_blank">RevenueCat Terms
              of
              Service</a></li>
        </ul>

        <h3>6.4 Managing Your Subscription</h3>
        <p>You can manage and cancel your Premium subscription through your device settings:</p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>iOS:</strong> Settings > [Your Name] > Subscriptions > Artkiv</li>
          <li><strong>Android:</strong> Google Play Store > Menu > Subscriptions > Artkiv</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Canceling your subscription will prevent future charges, but you will retain Premium access until the end of
          the
          current billing period. No partial refunds are provided for unused portions of the subscription period.</p>

        <h3>6.5 Refund Policy</h3>
        <p>All sales are final. Refund requests must be submitted through Apple App Store or Google Play Store in
          accordance
          with their respective refund policies. We do not have the ability to issue refunds directly.</p>
        <p>Apple and Google typically allow refund requests under the following circumstances:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Accidental purchases made by mistake</li>
          <li>Technical issues preventing app functionality</li>
          <li>Unauthorized purchases</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To request a refund:</p>

          <li>Any unlawful purpose or in violation of any local, state, national, or international law</li>
          <li>To transmit, or procure the sending of, any advertising or promotional material without our prior written

        </ul>

        <h2>10. Data Backup and Loss</h2>
        <p>Because Artkiv stores all data locally on your device:</p>

            other
            cause</li>
          <li>We do not provide data recovery services as we do not have access to your data</li>
          <li>Uninstalling the app will delete all data stored by Artkiv on your device</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>11. App Updates and Modifications</h2>
        <p>We reserve the right to:</p>

          <li>Modify, update, or discontinue any aspect of Artkiv at any time without notice</li>
          <li>Release updates that may add, modify, or remove features</li>
          <li>Change Premium subscription features, pricing, or terms with reasonable advance notice</li>
          <li>Require updates to continue using the App</li>
        </ul>
        <p>We will make reasonable efforts to maintain backward compatibility with your existing data, but we cannot
          guarantee
          that all features will remain available in future versions.</p>

          INCLUDING
          BUT NOT LIMITED TO:</p>

          to you.</p>

        <p>TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, WE SHALL NOT BE LIABLE FOR ANY INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL,

          <li>Business interruption or inability to use the App</li>
          <li>Costs of obtaining substitute services</li>

          IN THE 12 MONTHS PRECEDING THE CLAIM, OR $100 USD, WHICHEVER IS GREATER.</p>
        <p>Some jurisdictions do not allow limitations on liability, so these limitations may not apply to you.</p>
